# SouthVPN

**A school project for module M306**

---

## Description

SouthVPN is a school project where we set up our own VPN server and developed a matching desktop application.  
Since many existing VPN providers are either paid, full of ads, or limited in functionality, we aimed to create a better and free alternative that is stable, user-friendly, and ad-free.

The project was developed by three students over approximately 15 hours. The VPN server is hosted on a home server located in Switzerland.
