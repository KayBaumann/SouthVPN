# SouthVPN

**A small school project for M306**

---

## Description

SouthVPN is a school project where we set up our own VPN server and develop a matching desktop application.  
Since many existing VPN providers are either paid, slow, or limited in functionality, we aim to offer a better, free alternative.
The project is developed by three students over approximately 15 hours and is hosted on a home server located in Switzerland.
